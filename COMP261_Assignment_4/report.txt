COMP261 Assignment 4 Report

I have attempted and completed Stage 0, Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the assignment, The nodes are split up into
seperate packages in regards to what type of node they are (e.g. conditional, sensor etc). My parser seems to work correctly
with all the stage simple and full files aswell as the bad files in terms of it correctly throws an error. Two prog files in particular
however pass, s1_bad3.prog and s1_bad4.prog pass due to the later requirement of extending comparisons between all expressions rather
than just a sensor and number. I'm not sure if these prog files are meant to still fail after implementing stage 2 however i couldn't
think of a way to implement the stage 2 requirement while still having those prog files throw a parser error
