Question 1.

With my implementation of these two algorithms, i found varying results with Brute Force search being fast than KMP search
and vice versa however generally more than often the KMP search had a fast search time than the Brute Force search.

Question 2.

The final size of the war and peace text after the Huffman coding algorithm was 1848598 bytes, 

Question 3.

War and Peace had a size reduction of 1,409,648 bytes, Pi had a size reduction of 566,371 bytes and Taisho had
a size reduction of 2,107,288 bytes.

Based on the total amount of bytes reduced, Taisho had the most bytes reduced with 2,107,288 bytes.

Based on percentage compared with the input size of the file, Taisho had the highest percentage of size reduced with 57.73% of it's total input size
followed by Pi with 56.08% and lastly War and Peace with 43.26%

Curiously Taisho was larger than War and Peace with an input byte size difference of 391,698 however Taisho's reduction percentage was much higher
than War and Peace's reduction by roughly 14%. Due to the two texts being in different languages, we could say encoding could be better with different languages
than others.

Question 4.

Using text War and Peace, I increased the window size to 120 and 160 seperately aswell as reduced the window size to 80 and 40 seperately.

Compressing at window size 100, the character amount was 12,501,166.

After increasing the window size to 120 and 160, the character amount was 12,488,996 and 12,015,222 respectively

Reducing the window size to 80 and 40, the character amount was 12,953,392 and 15,458,921 respectively

So it seems reducing the window size will affect the character amount significantly

Question 5.

Huffman encoding War and Peace and then Lempel-Ziv compression gives a file size of 18,293,816 in terms of characters

Without encoding War and Peace and just performing Lempel-Ziv compression gives a file size of 12,501,166 in terms of characters

So Huffman encoding and then performing Lempel-Ziv compression does not give a smaller file size, at least for the War and Peace text
